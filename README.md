# Object-identification
This project leads to detect and identify objects in a sequence of video, the first task aims to detect objects by YOLO descriptor, then, I cropped the bounds of the objects, and I matched the similar objects using SIFT algorithm
The project contains tree part of code seperated:
The first code:"YOLO_part"
The second code: "CROP_part"
The third code: "SIFT_part"
