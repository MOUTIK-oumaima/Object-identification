# Object-identification
This project leads to detect and identify objects in a sequence of video, the first task aims to detect objects by YOLO descriptor, then, I cropped the bounds of the objects, and I matched the similar objects using SIFT algorithm
CODES:
The project contains tree part of code seperated:
The first code:YOLO_part
The second code: CROP_part
The third code: SIFT_part
INSTALATION NEEDED:
In YOLO part, i dowloaded the pre-trained model in COCO dataset : yolov3.weights (242 195 ko) i couldn't import it in the project regarding the size of the file.
